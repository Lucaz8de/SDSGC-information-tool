# SDSGC Information Tool
This program is a tool for searching for information about the mobile game, Seven Deadly Sins Grand Cross. For example, you can ask for a list of the characters that are good, the characters you don't have, the characters you have at a certain ultimate move level, the characters that are currently acquirable. Personally, I made the tool to help myself easily see how good a draw is, without going back 100 times to the heroes list! I find access to information in game pretty much impossible - so I hope that this tool can help you too. :)

## Installation
There are no requirements to use the program! It's a simple command line script.

### Build from source
I recommend doing this if you can - it should almost certainly work on all platforms. You need git, C++11 and cmake to build the program. Download and build it from the command line.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lucaz8de/SDSGC-information-tool.git
cd SDSGC-information-tool
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

Run it from the command line in the build directory:
```bash
cd build
./SDSGC-information-tool
```

### Packaged
You're welcome to try downloading a copy of mine, but I'm really not as sure that that will work.
